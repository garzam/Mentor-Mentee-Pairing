# Mentor-Mentee-Pairing

This file provides instructions for setting up, executing, and understanding the GitHub Actions workflow that runs your Python script. The script in this repository matches mentors and mentees based on the data from two Excel files: one containing mentor data and one containing mentee data. The script is designed to pair mentors and mentees based on answers from their respective questionnaires.
